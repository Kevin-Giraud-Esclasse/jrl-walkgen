Installation instructions specific to walkGenJrl
================================================

This file explains how to install walkGenJrl lib. It does not compile and
instal the plugin.

************
*For Linux.*
************

Basic Installation
------------------


Old way (autoconf):

To install do the following steps:
./autogen.sh

mkdir build
cd build

../configure --prefix=PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR  --with-boost=BOOSTDIR --with-boost-sandbox=BOOSTDIR_SANDBOX

make 
make install



New way (cmake):

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_INSTALL=PATH_TO_INSTALLDIR ..

CMake should be 2.6 at least.

It will try to find itself OpenHRP and boost, as well as the others packages.

It might however failed.
In this case, please run:
ccmake ..
and set the appropriate variables:
OPENHRP3_HOME
OPENHRP_HOME

If blas and lapack needs gfortran or f2c it is very likely
that cmake will not find it. Thus you should specify it with
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS, either with cmake:
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_INSTALL=PATH_TO_INSTALLDIR -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-lgfortran ..
or with ccmake by toggling the advanced options.

************
*For VS 8. *
************

Install mingw, and make sure that all the enviroment variables
are set up properly.
We have tested cmake with the "NMake Makefiles" generator.
